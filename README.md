# Cache-lookup-algorithm-simulation
This repository investigates alternative lookup algorithms for an IPâ†’MAC address cache (the local table hosts and routers use after ARP/NDP resolution). The goal is to implement three candidate lookup algorithms in MATLAB, define meaningful performance metrics, and run controlled experiments to compare their behaviour under realistic workloads (e.g. random lookups, skewed popularity, temporally-local access). The focus is on the efficiency of search and update operations rather than on networking functionality beyond the lookup itself.
